"""
In this example we will use the scipy.optimize.minimize function to search for the optimal combination of houses the 
project developer should develop to make the highest profit given all constraints. Since this is a rather simple 
linear problem, we can use a simple and fast solver like the one provided with scipy.

To be able to optimize, we need to define the objective as an python function. Similar we need to define a function for 
the constraint. This is done below, after which the optimization is performed on line 41 and the result is stored to the
variable 'result. This optimal result is also printed on line 54-57.'

For documentation on scipy.optimize.minimize please see the website of scipy or use the help() function.

Explanation of arguments:

fun: function to minimize, here: objective function
x0: initial guesses for the design variables x1 and x2
method: optimization method. The specified method allows for both bounds and constraints.
bounds: boundary values for design variables x1 and x2
constraints: dictionary that contains the type of constraint and the constraint function.
